# AeroAutoPlay
AeroAutoPlay is a lightweight utility that brings back the classic, functional AutoPlay dialog from Windows 7 to modern Windows 10 and 11 systems. It replaces the simplified modern notification with a central, actionable window that gives you immediate control when connecting a USB drive, external hard drive, memory card, or DVD.

Key Features:

Classic Dialog Window: Get a clear, central pop-up dialog upon connecting any media, just like in Windows 7 and XP.

Instant Action Choice: Choose what to do each time you connect a device: open folders, play media, view pictures, or run a custom application.

Per-Device Flexibility: Set default actions for different media types (USB drives, DVDs, CDs, cameras) and content types (music, video, pictures, mixed files).

System Integration: Runs seamlessly in the background as a low-resource service, integrating with Windows without conflicts.

Clarity and Control: Regain visibility and command over your removable media, making workflow faster and more predictable.
